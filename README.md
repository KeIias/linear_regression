# linear_regression
The goal of this project is to find the closest y = ax + b function that matches given coordinate points.

This solution uses gradient descent and prints the computed coefficients in the theta_values file when running train.py. Train.py also displays a graph containing points showing the training data as well as the computed function. There is also a representation of the lowering error over the training iterations.

Once training is done you can run predict.py in order to predict a new value.
